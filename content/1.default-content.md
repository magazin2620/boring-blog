Slots in Vue can have default content, but my favourite use is to create extension points.

Basically, you take any part of a component, wrap it in a slot, and now you can override that part of the component with whatever you want:

```vue
<template>
	<button class="button" @click="$emit('click')">
		<slot>
			<div class="formatting">
				{{ text }}
			</div>
		</slot>
	</button>
</template>
```

By default it'll still work the way it always has, but now you have more options.

You can use this component in a couple different ways. The easy, default way, or your own, custom way:

```html
<ButtonWithExtensionPoint text="Formatted text" />
<ButtonWithExtensionPoint>
	<div class="different-formatting">Do something</div>
</ButtonWithExtensionPoint>
```
