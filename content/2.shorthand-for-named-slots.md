Named slots also have a shorthand syntax, one that's much nicer to look at.

Instead of writing this:

```html
<DataTable>
	<template v-slot:header>
		<TableHeader />
	</template>
</DataTable>
```

We can write this:

```html
<DataTable>
	<template #header>
		<TableHeader />
	</template>
</DataTable>
```

Not a huge difference, but a little cleaner for sure. I think the # character is easier to pick out than v-slot when reading code.
