Instead of using v-if, it's sometimes more performant to use v-show:

```html
<ComplicatedChart v-show="chartEnabled" />
```

When v-if is toggled on and off it will create and destroy the element completely. Instead, v-show will create the element and leave it there, hiding it by setting it's style to display: none.

Doing this can be much more efficient if the component you're toggling is expensive to render.

On the flip side, if you don't need that expensive component immediately, use v-if so that it will skip rendering it and load the page just a bit faster.
