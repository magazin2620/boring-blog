Every now and then you just need a small component, one that's not worth an entirely new file:

```js
// A small, secondary component
const SmallComponent = {
	data(){ ... },
	computedProps: { ... },
	// Use the template property instead of a template block
	template: `<div>Hello!</div>`
	};
// Your main component
export default { components: { SmallComponent }, ... };
```

This is perfect for reusing code within a component, where a v-for doesn't work.

However, if the code is more complex or is likely to be used by other components, making a proper reusable component is the best way to go.

## Export multiple components

You can also export multiple components by adding the export keyword:

```js
export const SmallComponent = {
  data() { ... },
  computedProps: { ... },
  // Use the template property instead of a template block
  template: ` <div>Hello!</div> `
};
```

To import this, you'll have to use a slightly different syntax:

```js
import MainComponent, { SmallComponent } from './MultipleComponentsInOneFile.vue';
```
